Here‚Äôs a script named `30-CreateScoringImage.py` that aligns with your description. It assumes you're using Azure Machine Learning (AML), Azure Container Registry (ACR), and Docker to create and publish a scoring image:

### üìÑ `30-CreateScoringImage.py`

```python
import json
import os
from azureml.core import Workspace, Image
from azureml.core.model import Model
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice, Webservice
from azureml.core.image import ContainerImage

# Load workspace configuration
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Define model and environment details
model_name = "your_model_name"
environment_name = "your_environment_name"
image_name = "scoring-image"
image_version = "1"

# Load model
model = Model(ws, name=model_name)

# Load environment
env = Environment.get(workspace=ws, name=environment_name)

# Define inference configuration
from azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig
inference_config = InferenceConfig(entry_script="score.py", environment=env)

# Create image configuration
image_config = ContainerImage.image_configuration(
    execution_script="score.py",
    runtime="python",
    conda_file="env.yml",
    dependencies=["./"],
    description="Scoring image for model deployment",
    tags={"area": "scoring", "type": "production"}
)

# Build the Docker image
print("Creating Docker image...")
image = Image.create(
    name=image_name,
    models=[model],
    image_config=image_config,
    workspace=ws
)

image.wait_for_creation(show_output=True)

# Verify image status
if image.creation_state != 'Succeeded':
    raise Exception("Image creation failed: {}".format(image.creation_state))

print(f"Image created: {image.name}:{image.version}")

# Save image metadata to image.json
image_metadata = {
    "image_name": image.name,
    "image_version": image.version,
    "image_location": image.image_location
}

with open("image.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(image_metadata, f, indent=4)

print("Image metadata written to image.json.")
```

### ‚úÖ Requirements

* `score.py`: Your scoring script.
* `env.yml`: Conda environment file used to create your custom environment.
* Azure Machine Learning workspace configured (`config.json` in root).

---

### üîß Notes

* Replace `"your_model_name"` and `"your_environment_name"` with actual names.
* Ensure Docker is enabled in your AML workspace if you‚Äôre using a private ACR.
* This script can be run as a build task in CI/CD (e.g., Azure Pipelines).

Would you like help with the `score.py` or `env.yml` file too?


The line:

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

loads the Azure Machine Learning **workspace configuration** from a file named **`config.json`**, typically located in the **current working directory** (or a specified path).

---

### üîç How it works

* By default, `Workspace.from_config()` looks for a file named **`config.json`** in:

  * the **current directory**, or
  * a **`config_path`** if provided explicitly.

---

### üìÅ Example of `config.json`

This file contains details needed to connect to your Azure ML Workspace:

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "resource_group": "my-resource-group",
  "workspace_name": "my-aml-workspace"
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Where to get `config.json`

* You can **download** this from the Azure ML Studio:

  1. Go to your Azure ML workspace in the Azure Portal or Studio.
  2. Click on the ‚öôÔ∏è (top-right) ‚Üí "Download config.json".

* Or generate it in Python:

  ```python
  from azureml.core import Workspace

  ws = Workspace(
      subscription_id="xxxx",
      resource_group="my-resource-group",
      workspace_name="my-aml-workspace"
  )
  ws.write_config(path=".")
  ```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Specify Path

You can specify the path if it's in a subdirectory:

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config(path="./aml_config")
```

Let me know if you'd like help generating or verifying the config.
