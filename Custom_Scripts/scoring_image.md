Here’s a script named `30-CreateScoringImage.py` that aligns with your description. It assumes you're using Azure Machine Learning (AML), Azure Container Registry (ACR), and Docker to create and publish a scoring image:

### 📄 `30-CreateScoringImage.py`

```python
import json
import os
from azureml.core import Workspace, Image
from azureml.core.model import Model
from azureml.core.environment import Environment
from azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice, Webservice
from azureml.core.image import ContainerImage

# Load workspace configuration
ws = Workspace.from_config()

# Define model and environment details
model_name = "your_model_name"
environment_name = "your_environment_name"
image_name = "scoring-image"
image_version = "1"

# Load model
model = Model(ws, name=model_name)

# Load environment
env = Environment.get(workspace=ws, name=environment_name)

# Define inference configuration
from azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig
inference_config = InferenceConfig(entry_script="score.py", environment=env)

# Create image configuration
image_config = ContainerImage.image_configuration(
    execution_script="score.py",
    runtime="python",
    conda_file="env.yml",
    dependencies=["./"],
    description="Scoring image for model deployment",
    tags={"area": "scoring", "type": "production"}
)

# Build the Docker image
print("Creating Docker image...")
image = Image.create(
    name=image_name,
    models=[model],
    image_config=image_config,
    workspace=ws
)

image.wait_for_creation(show_output=True)

# Verify image status
if image.creation_state != 'Succeeded':
    raise Exception("Image creation failed: {}".format(image.creation_state))

print(f"Image created: {image.name}:{image.version}")

# Save image metadata to image.json
image_metadata = {
    "image_name": image.name,
    "image_version": image.version,
    "image_location": image.image_location
}

with open("image.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(image_metadata, f, indent=4)

print("Image metadata written to image.json.")
```

### ✅ Requirements

* `score.py`: Your scoring script.
* `env.yml`: Conda environment file used to create your custom environment.
* Azure Machine Learning workspace configured (`config.json` in root).

---

### 🔧 Notes

* Replace `"your_model_name"` and `"your_environment_name"` with actual names.
* Ensure Docker is enabled in your AML workspace if you’re using a private ACR.
* This script can be run as a build task in CI/CD (e.g., Azure Pipelines).

Would you like help with the `score.py` or `env.yml` file too?


The line:

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config()
```

loads the Azure Machine Learning **workspace configuration** from a file named **`config.json`**, typically located in the **current working directory** (or a specified path).

---

### 🔍 How it works

* By default, `Workspace.from_config()` looks for a file named **`config.json`** in:

  * the **current directory**, or
  * a **`config_path`** if provided explicitly.

---

### 📁 Example of `config.json`

This file contains details needed to connect to your Azure ML Workspace:

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "resource_group": "my-resource-group",
  "workspace_name": "my-aml-workspace"
}
```

---

### ✅ Where to get `config.json`

* You can **download** this from the Azure ML Studio:

  1. Go to your Azure ML workspace in the Azure Portal or Studio.
  2. Click on the ⚙️ (top-right) → "Download config.json".

* Or generate it in Python:

  ```python
  from azureml.core import Workspace

  ws = Workspace(
      subscription_id="xxxx",
      resource_group="my-resource-group",
      workspace_name="my-aml-workspace"
  )
  ws.write_config(path=".")
  ```

---

### 🛠️ Alternative: Specify Path

You can specify the path if it's in a subdirectory:

```python
ws = Workspace.from_config(path="./aml_config")
```
Excellent question.

### 🐳 What is a **Scoring Webservice Docker Image**?

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔍 1. **Docker Image**

A **Docker image** is a lightweight, standalone package that contains:

* Code (your model scoring logic)
* Dependencies (Python packages, OS libraries)
* Configuration (environment variables, ports, etc.)

> Think of it like a "boxed app" that runs exactly the same anywhere.

---

### 🔍 2. **Webservice**

A **webservice** is a program that listens for requests over the network (usually HTTP/REST) and sends back responses.

In the context of Azure ML:

* The webservice **takes input data**, sends it to your **model**, and returns **predictions**.
* It's usually deployed as a **REST API** that your application or users can call.

---

### 🔍 3. **Scoring**

**Scoring** means using a trained model to generate predictions.

So a **scoring webservice**:

* Accepts data (e.g., JSON)
* Passes it to your model
* Returns predictions

---

### ✅ Putting It Together

> A **scoring webservice Docker image** is a Docker image that contains:
>
> * Your trained model
> * A Python script (`score.py`) to load the model and run predictions
> * The runtime environment (Python, packages)
> * An HTTP interface (via Azure ML or Flask/FastAPI under the hood) to accept requests

Azure ML uses this image to **deploy a containerized REST API** that serves predictions.

---

### 🧠 Why is this useful?

* Runs consistently across machines and environments (local, cloud, on-prem).
* Scalable: Azure can deploy this container to AKS, ACI, or edge devices.
* Reusable: Once built, you can deploy the same image multiple times.

---

Would you like a visual diagram of how this works, or an example REST call to the deployed scoring service?

Great! Here's both a **diagram** and a **real-world example** to help you clearly understand what a **scoring webservice Docker image** does and how it's used.

## 🌐 **Example Request & Response**

Assume you've deployed a model that predicts **house prices**.

### 🔸 Request (to your scoring webservice)

```http
POST https://my-scoring-service.eastus.azurecontainer.io/score
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "data": [
    {
      "square_feet": 1500,
      "num_bedrooms": 3,
      "location": "suburban"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🔹 Response

```json
{
  "predictions": [280000]
}
```

Your application can now display the predicted price (`$280,000`) instantly to users.
