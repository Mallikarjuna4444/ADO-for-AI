The line:

```python
env = Environment.get(workspace=ws, name=environment_name)
```

loads a **registered Azure ML environment** by name from your workspace.

---

### 🔍 What’s Happening Here

* `Environment.get()` retrieves an environment **previously created and registered** in the Azure ML Workspace.
* `workspace=ws`: Refers to your Azure ML workspace instance.
* `name=environment_name`: The name of the environment you want to load.

### 📦 What Is an Environment in Azure ML?

An **Azure ML Environment** defines the Python/R runtime, packages, Docker base image, and environment variables needed for training or inference.

Think of it like a virtual environment or Docker image blueprint.

---

### 🔧 When Would This Work?

Only if:

* The environment was **already created and registered** using something like:

  ```python
  from azureml.core import Environment

  env = Environment.from_conda_specification(name="my-env", file_path="env.yml")
  env.register(workspace=ws)
  ```

---

### ❗Common Errors

* **`EnvironmentException: Environment my-env not found in the workspace.`**

  * This means the named environment was not registered yet.
  * You either need to register it (using the above code), or create it inline.

---

### ✅ Fix: Create & Register If Not Yet Registered

If you're not sure the environment exists yet, you can create it:

```python
from azureml.core import Environment

env = Environment.from_conda_specification(name="my-env", file_path="env.yml")
env.register(workspace=ws)
```
